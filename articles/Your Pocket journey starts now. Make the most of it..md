Welcome to Pocket. You’re about to embark on a journey, one where the vast swaths of information you discover online become knowledge. Everywhere you go with Pocket, the words, sounds, and stories that delight, enlighten, and even shape you will be at your fingertips. And you’ll be able to consume and organize it all in whatever way works best for you.

Modern life moves pretty fast, and information is abundant. There’s no shortage of distractions to pull your focus from what matters. Pocket can help restore that focus. It’s a clean, easy way to capture the things you find interesting and to give them more attention when you’re ready — free from popups and other concentration killers.

Here are three tips to help you make the most of your journey.

Use Pocket everywhere you are
-----------------------------

Pocket is available everywhere you need it, across devices and browsers. So when you see an article or video that catches your eye, or read something you know you want to dive back into, those items can come with you, wherever you go. Save an article on your computer, and it’s there in your Pocket when you open the app on your phone or tablet. If you use Firefox, Pocket is already built in. If you’re on another browser, download the Pocket extension and you can save anything with just one click.

Your Pocket list is always up-to-date in the apps, or at [_getpocket.com_](https://getpocket.com/)_,_ ready for you to read, listen to, or watch.

Make Pocket your quiet corner of the web
----------------------------------------

Whenever you have a minute, the best content you’ve collected is waiting there for you, even offline. Articles, essays, long reads, how-to videos — whatever great internet content you’ve captured, Pocket keeps it all for you. As you add to your list, Pocket becomes a reflection and collection of your interests and aspirations. You can save any online content you like and turn it into your own personal library. Your own quiet corner of the web.

It’s your Pocket, any way you want it
-------------------------------------

The listen feature can read your saved articles to you. So when you are on the go or your hands are full, Pocket can keep you connected to the stories you love. Tap on the headphones icon in the app to start listening. You can turn any moment into an opportunity to be focused on the things you care about.

Set Pocket to dark or sepia mode and read without over-stimulating your eyes before you go to sleep. You can also change the font settings in the article view and find the perfect text size for comfortable reading.

The internet is full of information and entertainment, sometimes a mixture of the two. Your journey may have you changing careers, planning great travel adventures, cooking up a storm, or laughing yourself silly. Where your journey takes you and what you’ll learn is unknown, but you’ll always have what you need in your Pocket.
